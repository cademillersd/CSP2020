    <b1>My first project was the "Turtle Spangled Banner". My group and I drew inspiration from the Star Spangled Banner in order to code a somewhat accurate replica.
	We decided to go with turtles instead of the stars to incorparate what we had been working on for the past week. We decided to tell a story with out movement.
        The red turtle at the top of the Turtle Spangled Banner represents a teacher turning his back to the class while the mischevious yellow turtles (the students)
        pass a note around the classroom. We finalized the project by giving our centerpiece a fitting background that included a simple sun and straightforward 
	backdrop.<b1>
