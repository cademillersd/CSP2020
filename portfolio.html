    <h1>My first project was the "Turtle Spangled Banner". My group and I drew inspiration from the Star Spangled Banner in order to code a somewhat accurate replica.
	We decided to go with turtles instead of the stars to incorparate what we had been working on for the past week. We decided to tell a story with out movement.
        The red turtle at the top of the Turtle Spangled Banner represents a teacher turning his back to the class while the mischevious yellow turtles (the students)
        pass a note around the classroom. We finalized the project by giving our centerpiece a fitting background that included a simple sun and straightforward 
	backdrop.<h1>

    <h2>My second project was "Firefighter". The basis of the game is centered aroun the pythagorean theorem. You are given the height and length you, the firefighter,
        are away from the building and are tasked with giving the correct hypotenuse. That answer will determine how far the water will shoot and ultimately determine
        whether or not you put out the fire. <h2>

    <h3> My third project was "Liberating Willy". My group found inspiration from the Seaworld Blackfish documentary that describes the horrific conditions the whales 
	 and other sea creatures endure. The game shares a similar game design to Flappy Bird where the ultimate goal is to continue jumping through two pipes to increase th
	 the score. <h3>
